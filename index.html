  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 9, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>App Name:</strong> МаршрутПро</p>
  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Akbarov Akbar Nabijonovich</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the "МаршрутПро" mobile application ("the App") collects, uses, and protects user data. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>The App does <strong>not collect or store any personal data</strong> from users. Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No registration or login is required.</li>
    <li>No name, phone number, email, or other personal details are requested.</li>
    <li>No photos, files, or messages are accessed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Location Data</h2>
  <p>The App may access your <strong>device's location</strong> (with your permission) in order to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Show your current location on the map.</li>
    <li>Help you find nearby bus routes or stops.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Location data is used <strong>only within the app</strong> and is <strong>not stored or shared</strong> with any external server or third party.</p>

  <h2>4. Offline and Cached Data</h2>
  <p>To improve performance, the App stores <strong>route and stop data</strong> locally on your device. This data includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bus stop coordinates and names</li>
    <li>Route paths and segments</li>
    <li>Previously viewed data</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No user-related data is cached.</p>

  <h2>5. Internet Access</h2>
  <p>The App may access the internet to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Download updated route and stop data</li>
    <li>Load maps (from services like OpenStreetMap)</li>
    <li>Check for app updates or display news (optional)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This usage is strictly technical and does not involve user identification.</p>

  <h2>6. Developer Mode</h2>
  <p>The App includes a <strong>Developer Mode</strong> intended for internal use only and not available to regular users. Access to this mode is restricted by a login and password. It allows authorized developers to manage and edit route and stop data. No personal user data is collected or processed in Developer Mode.</p>

  <h2>7. Ads and Analytics</h2>
  <p>The App <strong>does not contain ads</strong> and <strong>does not use any analytics tools</strong> (such as Google Analytics or Firebase).</p>

  <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App may use external services such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>OpenStreetMap</strong> – for displaying maps.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These services are used only to visualize public map data and do not receive any user data from the App.</p>

  <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We do not collect any personal information; therefore, no personal data is at risk. All cached technical data is stored securely on the user's device.</p>

  <h2>10. Advertising ID</h2>
  <p>The App uses the device's Advertising ID solely for displaying ads. This identifier may be accessed by included advertising SDKs (such as AdMob) to provide personalized or contextual advertising. While the App itself does not process this ID directly, the SDK may use it for ad-related purposes.

Please note: some SDKs may also perform limited analytics using the Advertising ID. The App does not actively collect or analyze such data.</p>

  <h2>11. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is suitable for users of all ages and complies with COPPA. It does not contain content inappropriate for children. However, children under 13 should use the App under parental supervision, especially if location access is enabled.</p>

  <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If changes are made, the updated version will be available at the official link provided in the app's store listing.</p>

  <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us:</p>
